This repo has three folders- one for each question in the assessment, pertaining to SDTM, ADaM and TLGs. 
Within each folder are four more folders- 'programs', 'output', 'log', and 'metadata'. 

Though question 01 and question 02 required the delivery of only one program each, compared to question 03 
which required the delivery of two programs, I have created 'programs' folder within the question 01 and 
question 02 folders as well, to keep the folder structure uniform. The 'metadata' folder can be used to store 
metadata like a CT file. Since I have created the CT file required for question 01 programmatically, and the 
other questions did not require any metadata, all metadata folders are blank.
