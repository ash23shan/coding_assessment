This repo has three folders- one for each question in the assessment, pertaining to SDTM, ADaM and TLGs. 
Within each folder are three more folders- 'programs', 'output', and 'log'. 

Though question 01 and question 02 required the delivery of only one program each, compared to question 03 
which required the delivery of two programs, I have created the 'programs' folder within question 01 and 
question 02 folders as well, to keep the folder structure uniform. Within Posit, I had also created 'metadata' 
sub- folders intended for storage of  metadata like a CT file. I ended up not storing any metadata within them since 
I created the CT file required for question 01 programmatically, for the reason explained within the program and the 
other questions did not require any metadata. The empty metadata folders, therefore, did not get pushed to GitHub.
